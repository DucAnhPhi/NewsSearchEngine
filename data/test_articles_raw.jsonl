The state chairman, Harris, a Taft man, was told if he tried to put over any crooked deals from the chair that he wouldn’t get out of the hall alive. Feelings ran so high that gun-play was expected.

This Roosevelt was also capable of turning on a dime without conceding that he had gone anywhere but straight. “Let the people rule,” Roosevelt declared, but he didn’t mean all the people all the time. When it served his purposes to include African Americans, he was more than happy to accept their votes. But when the black vote worked against him — when, having won most of the primaries but lost the Republican nomination to Taft, he became the nominee of the Progressive Party and feared frightening off Southern whites — he took pains to exclude them. “I believe the great majority of the negroes in the South are wholly unfit for suffrage,” he declared in what was either a moment of candor or a moment of expedience.
